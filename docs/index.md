# 3DCP.fyi

> Relax, this isn't another review paper on 3D concrete printing (**3DCP**)! Instead, we've curated an exhaustive 
database that offers a detailed look at the state-of-the-art in 3D-printing in the construction industry, mostly, 
but not exclusively, involving cementitious materials and extrusion-based manufacturing.

## About This Database

To guarantee the dataset's quality and consistency, we've taken the extra step of manually curating each entry over the years, which means:

- [x] Authors are identified through their **ORCiD** profiles
- [ ] Universities are tagged with their respective **ROR**s (upcoming feature)
- [ ] Citations have a semantic weight (upcoming feature)
- [x] Open accessible papers are tagged and can be downloaded directly
- [x] Year of publication is enhanced by the month
- [x] Publications are evaluated by several of their centralities in the citation network over multiple [topological generations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting)
- [x] Links to third party services are provided
- [ ] Community detection is applied to identify clusters of related works (upcoming feature)

## Database Statistics

- **Scientific Works**: ~4,000 entries
- **Evaluated Citations**: ~69,285 citations
- **Date Range**: February 1997 to July 2025
